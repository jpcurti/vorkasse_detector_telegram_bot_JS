# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

The telegram token, group id and server port are stored as environment variables BOT_TOKEN, CHAT_ID and PORT. To run the script with your variables, run:
```
BOT_TOKEN=yourbotid:yourbothash CHAT_ID=yourchatoruserID PORT=8081 node index.js
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
